# Cryptocurrency Prediction Based on One Hour Change Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Cryptocurrency trade is gaining popularity in financial markets in recent years, however, the uncertainty and volatility in its price change has risked the investment. Thus, many intelligent forecasting models based on the price changes have been created by the previous researches to predict and analyze the factors affecting popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litcoin (LTC). In this paper, we build a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and a Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model that focus only on two less-studied cryptocurrencies, Cardano and Solana. Our results showed that LSTM model was able to predict the 10 cryptocurrency prices more accurately.
